## Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Project:** Wingard

### 1. Introduction & Vision

Wingard is a native Windows desktop application designed to be the definitive GUI for the `winget` command-line tool. It provides a secure, reliable, and visually elegant interface for users to manage and update their installed software. By abstracting the complexity of the command line and providing a modern, user-friendly experience, Wingard aims to become the go-to utility for power users and system administrators who value efficiency and control.

### 2. User Personas

#### 2.1. Primary Persona: The Power User / IT Pro ("Alex")
*   **Description:** Alex is a software developer, IT professional, or tech enthusiast. They are highly comfortable with the Windows ecosystem and may already use `winget` in the terminal. They manage a large number of applications and need to keep them updated for security and feature reasons.
*   **Goals:**
    *   To see at a glance which applications have pending updates.
    *   To batch-update all applications quickly and reliably.
    *   To find and uninstall software without navigating the slow, built-in Windows "Apps & features" panel.
    *   To have a polished, performant tool that respects their time and workflow.
*   **Frustrations:**
    *   Typing repetitive commands in the terminal is inefficient.
    *   It's hard to get a quick, visual overview of system state from the command line.
    *   The standard Windows uninstaller is slow and clunky.

### 3. Product Roadmap

Wingard will be developed with a single, comprehensive V1 release, defined as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Future versions can expand on this solid foundation.

#### **Phase 1: V1 (MVP) - The Definitive App Manager**
*   **Goal:** To deliver the complete, core experience for managing and updating existing software.
*   **Status:** **Currently specified for development.**

#### **Phase 2: V2 - Discovery & Advanced Management (Future)**
*   **Goal:** To expand Wingard from a manager to a full-fledged discovery tool.
*   **Potential Features:**
    *   Global Search functionality for finding and installing new packages from `winget` repositories.
    *   Management of `winget` sources.
    *   Package pinning to exclude specific apps from updates.

### 4. V1 Functional Requirements & User Stories

The following requirements define the scope of the Wingard V1 release.

#### **FR-1: Core Application & Execution**
*   **USR-1.1:** As a user, when I launch Wingard, the application must request administrator privileges via a standard UAC prompt so that all in-app actions can be performed without further interruption.
*   **USR-1.2:** As a user, the application window must remember its size and position from the last session to maintain my workspace context.
*   **USR-1.3:** As a user, I must be able to see a "Startup Health Check" result if the app cannot detect a functional `winget` installation, with guidance on how to fix it.

#### **FR-2: Updates View**
*   **USR-2.1:** As a user, the "Updates" view must be the default screen when I open the application.
*   **USR-2.2:** As a user, I must see a list of all applications that have a pending update. Each item must clearly display the application icon, name, current version, and the new available version.
*   **USR-2.3:** As a user, I must be able to click an "Update All" button to add all available updates to a sequential processing queue.
*   **USR-2.4:** As a user, I must be able to click an "Update" button on an individual package to update only that application.

#### **FR-3: Installed Apps View**
*   **USR-3.1:** As a user, I must be able to navigate to an "Installed Apps" view from the main sidebar.
*   **USR-3.2:** As a user, I must see a comprehensive list of all applications managed by `winget`. Each item must display the application icon, name, and its currently installed version.
*   **USR-3.3:** As a user, I must be able to type in a filter box to instantly and smoothly narrow down the list of applications in real-time.
*   **USR-3.4:** As a user, I must be able to click an "Uninstall" button on any package to remove it from my system.

#### **FR-4: Package Details & Navigation**
*   **USR-4.1:** As a user, I must be able to click on any package in any list to navigate to a dedicated "Package Detail" page.
*   **USR-4.2:** As a user, on the detail page, I must be able to view the package's icon, name, publisher, version, description, and other available metadata like homepage or license URLs.
*   **USR-4.3:** As a user, I must be able to click on any URL shown in the detail page to open it in my default web browser.

#### **FR-5: Feedback & UI/UX**
*   **USR-5.1:** As a user, I must see a persistent `ActivityPanel` at the bottom of the window that provides real-time status updates on any running or completed tasks.
*   **USR-5.2:** As a user, when an update task completes successfully, the application must automatically remove that item from the "Updates" list without requiring a manual refresh.
*   **USR-5.3:** As a user, I must see a modern skeleton loading effect (shimmer) while the application is fetching data to provide a perception of high performance.
*   **USR-5.4:** As a user, I must see a clear, helpful message if a view has no content (e.g., "You're all up to date!") or if an error occurs (e.g., "No internet connection").
*   **USR-5.5:** As a user, the application must display the best possible icon for each package, using a fallback system that tries the official icon, then a GitHub icon, and finally a generated placeholder icon.

#### **FR-6: Settings & Personalization**
*   **USR-6.1:** As a user, I must be able to navigate to a "Settings" page.
*   **USR-6.2:** As a user, I must be able to set the application theme to Light, Dark, or have it sync with my system theme.
*   **USR-6.3:** As a user, I must be able to change the application's display language from a list of available translations.

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

*   **NFR-1 (Performance):** The UI must remain responsive (60 FPS) at all times, with all I/O operations (running `winget`, fetching icons) performed on background threads.
*   **NFR-2 (Reliability):** The application must gracefully handle all identified edge cases (no internet, UAC cancellation, failed installers, hung processes) without crashing.
*   **NFR-3 (Usability):** The application must be navigable and usable in Windows' High Contrast mode for accessibility.
*   **NFR-4 (Maintainability):** The codebase must adhere strictly to the Feature-First architecture, with clear separation of concerns to allow for future development.
*   **NFR-5 (Distribution):** The application will be packaged as an `.msix` file for easy distribution and installation.
